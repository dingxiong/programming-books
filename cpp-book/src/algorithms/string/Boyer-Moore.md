# Boyerâ€“Moore

This is also a string matching algorithm. It has sublinear time complexity for
regular cases, but worse `O(n*m)` complexity, so it is frequently used in
practice, but not good for competitive programming. By the way, C++ 17 and
above has std implementation for Boyer-Moore search algorithm.
