# Introduction 

My notes about various programming topics.

## Add yarn and related tools

Even thought I hate using yarn/npm, but I can not find a good formatter at the
level of `prettier` in Rust.

```
nvm install 25.0.0
echo 25.0.0 > .nvmrc
npm install --global yarn
```



## cpp-book

Local development

```
mdbook serve --open
```
